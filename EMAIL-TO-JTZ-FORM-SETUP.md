Hi JTZ Team,

Thanks for asking about the form processing! Here's the simple answer:

## Use Your Existing Form Handler

Please point the tacky lights landing page form to **the same form processing endpoint you currently use for TNT's main website contact forms**.

This is the fastest and safest approach since that system is already working and delivering leads to our inbox.

---

## What You Need to Do:

### Step 1: Update the Form Action Attribute

**File:** `landing-page.html`
**Line:** 536

**Change this:**
```html
<form id="tackylights-form" action="#" method="POST">
```

**To this:**
```html
<form id="tackylights-form" action="YOUR_EXISTING_FORM_HANDLER.php" method="POST">
```

*(Replace `YOUR_EXISTING_FORM_HANDLER.php` with whatever endpoint you use for the current TNT website contact form)*

---

### Step 2: Process These Form Fields

The form collects the following data (all fields are already properly named in the HTML):

**Required Fields:**
- `firstName` - Text input
- `lastName` - Text input
- `email` - Email input (validated on client-side)
- `phone` - Phone number (auto-formatted on client-side as (XXX) XXX-XXXX)

**Optional Fields:**
- `tourDate` - Date picker (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
- `groupSize` - Dropdown select (values: "1-4", "5-8", "9-14", "15+")
- `tour_interest` - Checkbox (value: "yes" if checked, empty if unchecked)

**IMPORTANT:** The `tour_interest` checkbox indicates if the lead wants to book a professional tour. If this is checked, it's a **hot lead** who should be prioritized.

---

### Step 3: Email Notification Setup

**Send email notifications to:**
sedan@tntauto.com *(or whatever email TNT uses for website leads)*

**Suggested Email Format:**

**Subject Line:**
`New Tacky Lights Lead: [firstName] [lastName]`

**Email Body Template:**
```
New Tacky Lights Lead Received
================================

CONTACT INFORMATION:
--------------------
Name: [firstName] [lastName]
Email: [email]
Phone: [phone]

TOUR DETAILS:
-------------
Tour Interest: [tour_interest = "YES" if checked, "No" if unchecked]
Preferred Date: [tourDate or "Not specified"]
Group Size: [groupSize or "Not specified"]

---
Lead Source: Tacky Lights Landing Page
Submitted: [timestamp]
IP Address: [optional - if you track this]

[If tour_interest is checked, add this:]
⚠️ HOT LEAD: This person indicated interest in booking a professional tour!
```

---

### Step 4: Success Redirect (Optional)

After successful form submission, you can either:

**Option A:** Redirect to a thank-you page
**Option B:** Show an in-page success message
**Option C:** Trigger the PDF downloads automatically

We don't currently have a thank-you page built, so **Option B (in-page message)** is probably easiest for now.

You can use JavaScript to show a success message like:
```
"Thank you! We've received your information and will send your free guide shortly. A dispatcher will contact you within 24 hours if you indicated interest in booking a tour."
```

---

## That's It!

This should work exactly like your existing contact forms. The HTML structure, validation, and client-side formatting are all already handled in the code we provided.

**Questions?** Let us know if you need any clarification!

Best regards,
TNT Team

## OPTIONAL: Google Analytics Event Tracking

If TNT has Google Analytics installed and wants to track form conversions, you can add this **single line of code** to the form submit handler:

**File:** `landing-page.html`
**Location:** Inside the existing form submit event listener (around line 625)

**Add this line:**
```javascript
// Track form submission in Google Analytics
if (typeof gtag !== 'undefined') {
    gtag('event', 'form_submit', {
        'event_category': 'Tacky Lights Campaign',
        'event_label': document.querySelector('input[name="tour_interest"]').checked ? 'Tour Interest - Hot Lead' : 'Guide Download Only',
        'value': document.querySelector('input[name="tour_interest"]').checked ? 1 : 0
    });
}
```

This will let you see in Google Analytics:
- Total form submissions
- How many indicated tour interest (hot leads)
- Conversion rate from page visits → form fills

**No backend changes needed** - this is just client-side tracking.
